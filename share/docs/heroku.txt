*How can I deploy a ukigumo server on heroku?
You can deploy a Ukigumo server very easy.

1st, you would setup heroku account.

2nd, you would setup heroku toolbelt.

3rd, just deploy it with:

	% heroku create --buildpack https://github.com/miyagawa/heroku-buildpack-perl.git
	% git push heroku master

Very easy. If you want to use ukigumo as a private mode, you should put a following line on app.psgi.

	enable "Auth::Basic", authenticator => sub { return $_[0] eq 'admin' && $_[1] eq 'p4ssw0rd'; }

And you can access the URL like 'http://admin:p4ssw0rd@my-ukigumo-app.herokuapp.com/'.

That's all.
