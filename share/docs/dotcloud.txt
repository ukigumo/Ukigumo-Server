*How can I deploy a ukigumo server on dotcloud?
You can deploy a Ukigumo server very easy.

1st, you would setup dotcloud account.

2nd, you would setup dotcloud cli.

3rd, just deploy it with:

	% dotcloud create my-ukigumo
	% dotcloud push my-ukigumo

Very easy. If you want to use ukigumo as a private mode, you should put a following line on app.psgi.

	enable "Auth::Basic", authenticator => sub { return $_[0] eq 'admin' && $_[1] eq 'p4ssw0rd'; }

That's all.
